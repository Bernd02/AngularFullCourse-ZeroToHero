## Notes

Refresher for Angular.  
I learned Angular through the **Tour of Heroes** tutorial from 
https://angular.io/docs.   
I processed this course as a refresher (and more) for the Angular Framework.

This project is not a complete standalone application, but a collection of the different topics with small and easy examples of the principles and functions in the **Angular Framework**. I've listed them mostly in different angular components.

I find that full, high quality video-tutorials provide all kinds of **meta-data** in the form of **tips and tricks** you can hardly acquire from just reading the documentation. So in that regard this, tutorial was beneficial to me.

On the other hand, in the Angular documentation you can often find a bit more in depth information, which also can contribute to your knowledge. Currently, I find learning with these kinds of video-tutorials **in parallel** with the official documentation **the best way** to internalize the matter.

I'm sharing this to show what I've learned about the Angular Framework.
